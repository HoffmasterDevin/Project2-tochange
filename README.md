# About Fantasy Fitness Fighter
Fantasy Fitness Fighter is a game that is based on the type of health activities that you did for the day. First you would sign up and create an account. Once you are signed into your FFF account, you have the option to fight or check your fight history. Once you are on the fight page of the app, you will be asked to choose a level, depending on what level you choose will determine what creature your character will be fighting. The harder the level, the more damage points will be needed to defeat the character. Damage points vary depending on the health activity. The motivation for this development was realizing that working out would be more fun and motivating if we were able to make it into a game. 

# Technologies used: JavaScript, Handlebars, SQL, Heroku, Howler and Node_chron

**Future development will be added**
